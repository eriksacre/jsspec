# JSSPEC

In this repo I am playing with some tools to explore BDD for JavaScript development.

* Karma: test runner
* Jake: a kind of make/rake for JavaScript
* Jasmine: BDD framework
* JSHint
* Nodejs

These techniques and tools are based on the work by James Shore.

## Getting started

* Install nodejs
* Run script/setup to install required node packages
* ./jake karma -- this will start the karma server
* Point any browser you wish to test to localhost:9876 (or servername:9876 when using non-local browsers, e.g. tablets, phones...
* ./jake -- a lint and test run. I've setup a shortcut in Vim to run this command
